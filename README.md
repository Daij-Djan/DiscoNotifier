DiscoNotifier
=============

Menulet that uses FMDB to monitor the MountainLion Notification Center and pulses the MacBooks LED Keyboard whenever you receive any notification

Uses Private API as there is still no SDK for the LED Keyboard 

Also uses these 3rdparty projects
- DDOpenAtLoginController- fmdb- SCEvents

Works under 10.9 and 10.8  
But has only been tested on a MacbookPro 2011 with 10.9
